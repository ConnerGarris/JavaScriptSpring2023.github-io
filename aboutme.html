            <p>Hello, my name is Conner Garris and I am a student with a passion for coding. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science and have always been fascinated by how technology can solve complex problems
             and bring innovative ideas to life. My journey with coding started in high school and ever since then, I have been continuously learning new programming languages and technologies to expand my skillset. I have developed a strong foundation
            in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python and have worked on various projects ranging from simple websites to complex web applications. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and experimenting with new technologies.
            I believe that coding is not just a profession but a way of life and I am excited to take my skills to the next level and make a positive impact through my work.</p>
